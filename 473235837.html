                    <p><strong>Part II: Selected Languages</strong></p><p>Introduction: The languages I select from <em>List A: Imperative and Object-Oriented Languages are</em> <strong>C++</strong>, <strong>Javascript</strong>, and <strong>Swift; </strong>from<em> List B: Functional and Logic Languages</em> is <strong>Prolog</strong>; from <em>List C: Special Purpose Languages </em>is <strong>R</strong>.</p><p> </p><p>1. <strong>C++</strong></p><p>The purpose of designing C++ is to optimize the C language for individual programmers. C++ was designed with a bias toward system programming and embedded, resource-constrained software and large systems, with performance, efficiency, and flexibility of use as its design highlights. It is also used in domains including games, animation, web browsers, database access, etc. C++ was developed in <span style="color: rgb(34,34,34);">1998, is a compiled language, and is open source.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(34,34,34);"><br/></span></p><p>2. <strong>Javascript</strong></p><p>The design purpose of Javascript is <span style="color: rgb(34,34,34);">to simplify web development and make the web more attractive</span>. JavaScript is mainly used for web-based applications and web browsers but also used beyond the Web in software, servers and embedded hardware controls. Javascript was developed in 1995, is an interpreted language, and is open-source. </p><p> </p><p>3. <strong>Prolog</strong></p><p>The design purpose of Prolog was for natural language processing, which is to explore and prove theorems and real-world applications. The main uses of Prolog are theorem proving, expert systems, term rewriting, type systems, and automated planning. Prolog was developed in 1987 and can be both compiled or interpreted. My exploration tells that many parts of Prolog are open-source, such as some of the extensions.</p><p> </p><p>4. <strong>R</strong></p><p>R's design purpose is for statistical computing and graphics. The main uses of R includes<span style="color: rgb(68,68,68);"> developing &quot;<span style="color: rgb(68,68,68);">well-designed publication-quality plots&quot;, and being an<span style="color: rgb(34,34,34);"> important tool for development in the numeric analysis and machine learning spaces</span></span></span>. R was developed in the early 1990s, is an interpreted language, and is open-source.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Extension:</strong></p><p>5. <strong>Swift </strong></p><p>The design purpose of Swift is for systems programming, developing mobile and desktop apps, and scaling up to cloud services. The main use of Swift is to <span style="color: rgb(34,34,34);">create computer programs and mobile apps for iOS, macOS X, and Linux, as well as for the Apple Watch and AppleTV.</span> Swift was developed in 2014, is a compiled language, and is open-source.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Source</strong></p><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B</a></p><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript</a></p><p><a href="https://www.hackreactor.com/blog/what-is-javascript-used-for" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">https://www.hackreactor.com/blog/what-is-javascript-used-for</a></p><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prolog" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prolog</a></p><p><a href="https://www.r-project.org/about.html" rel="nofollow" class="external-link">https://www.r-project.org/about.html</a></p><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swift_(programming_language)" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swift_(programming_language)</a></p><p><a href="https://swift.org/about/" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">https://swift.org/about/</a></p>
